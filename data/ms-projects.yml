      Founded by Dr. Antonio Bertolotto, a neurologist with extensive experience in MS clinical management and research, CureMS is dedicated mainly to autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) because this procedure shows the most promising potential for approaching a cure in some patients.
      
      The website emphasizes scientific accuracy and peer-reviewed evidence, explicitly stating: "You won't find miraculous recipes or simple solutions to a complex problem like MS." All information is derived from articles published in scientific journals using the peer review method.
      
      The project is funded through donations to FORB (Fondazione per la Ricerca Biomedica), a non-profit organization affiliated with the University of Turin, ensuring complete independence from commercial interests.
