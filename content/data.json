The primary characteristic lesion of this disease is present in the corpus callosum in the form of its necrosis, but plenty of evidence suggests that it can also affect other parts of the brain. The main pathophysiology revolves around the consumption of alcohol and its ability to cause thiamine depletion in the body and hinder various metabolic pathways. There is also a hindrance in myelin synthesis, which further damages the signal transmission leading to an array of symptoms and signs. It is present in different degrees in patients in the form of different stages, namely acute, subacute, and chronic. The diagnosis of the disease becomes tough as the presenting symptoms are very generic and vague. Before the innovation of advanced imaging techniques, it was mainly a finding during an autopsy, but presently it can be diagnosed by a well-taken history and imaging techniques which can help to rule out other diseases having a similar clinical presentation. The gold standard for the diagnosis of the disease is using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to visualize the lesions present in the corpus callosum and other areas, but other methods like computed tomography (CT) are also used. The prognosis of the disease is influenced by many factors, and it varies greatly. Some factors such as broad involvement of the cerebral cortex and severe disturbances in consciousness are indicative of a poor prognosis. The differential diagnosis consists of other alcohol use disorders like Wernicke's encephalopathy, neoplastic conditions, and multiple sclerosis, to mention a few. Each one should be carefully eliminated before finalizing the diagnosis. The treatment of the disease is not concrete, but evidence shows improvement with specific interventions.</p><p>PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36457608/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=10guX6I3SqrbUeeLKSTD6FCRM44ewnrN2MKKTQLLPMHB4xNsZU&amp;fc=20210216052009&amp;ff=20221202071014&amp;v=2.17.8\">36457608</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC9706281/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=10guX6I3SqrbUeeLKSTD6FCRM44ewnrN2MKKTQLLPMHB4xNsZU&amp;fc=20210216052009&amp;ff=20221202071014&amp;v=2.17.8\">PMC9706281</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.30863\">10.7759/cureus.30863</a></p></div>","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36457608/?fc=20210216052009&ff=20221202071014&v=2.17.8","published_date":"2022-12-02T11:00:00Z","source":"PubMed","publisher":"Cureus","container_title":"Cureus","authors":[{"url":"http://api.gregory-ms.com/authors/80999/?format=json","family_name":"Singh","given_name":"Shailja","ORCID":null},{"url":"http://api.gregory-ms.com/authors/81000/?format=json","family_name":"Wagh","given_name":"Vasant","ORCID":null}],"relevant":null,"ml_prediction_gnb":false,"ml_prediction_lr":false,"discovery_date":"2022-12-02T12:11:00.066563Z","noun_phrases":["Marchiafava Bignami Disease","A Rare Neurological Complication","Long-Term Alcohol Abuse"],"doi":"10.7759/cureus.30863","access":"open","takeaways":" Marchiafava Bignami disease is a demyelinating and necrotic disease of the central nervous system in chronic alcohol users and malnourished patients .

Epub 2022 May 1.</p><p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p><p>INTRODUCTION: Sialic acid is pivotal in various critical physiological events at molecular and cellular levels and pathological processes. Changes in sialic acid concentration are observed in many pathological processes; for example, some available data exist on the evaluated level of sialic acid and neurodegenerative prevalence. Presumably, sialic acid can play a significant role in regulating a diverse range of uncovered neurodegeneration factors and downstream targets. matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP9) is one factor that changes the exposure of different concentrations of sialic acid solution. Hence, we aimed to examine the possible effect of sialic acid solution exposure on the glial cell line in the expression patterns of miR-320a and let-7e as two upstream factors.</p><p>METHODS: Human glial cell line was prepared from the Pasteur Institute of Iran and cultured in a dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The IC<sub>50</sub> value of sialic acid was obtained by colorimetric assay for assessing cell metabolic activity 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl (MTT), and the glial cell line was treated with sialic acid in 300, 500, 1000 μg/mL for 24 h to investigate the effect of the sialic acid ligand on the expression pattern of the miR-320a and let-7e. Total RNA was isolated from approximately 10×10<sup>6</sup> glial cells and was used from each sample for complementary dna (cDNA) synthesis. For quantitative analysis of miR-320a and let-7e, we used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and for statistical analysis, the SPSS v. 21 software was applied.</p><p>RESULTS: Analyzing the real-time data revealed that the expression of miR-320a and let-7e was significantly increased (P&lt;0.0001) in 300, 500, and 1000 μg/mL treated glial cells by sialic acid compared to the control group.</p><p>CONCLUSION: A possible linkage of sialic acid on miR-320a and let-7e regulation was observed in the glial cell line as proinflammatory factors in the inflammation pathway.</p><p>HIGHLIGHTS: Differing in sialic acid concentration is seen in various pathological states.MicroRNAs play a role in numerous biological processes and human disorders.miR-320a and let-7e expression levels displayed a significant increase in different sialic acid concentrations.</p><p>PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Inflammation in the nervous system occurs because of numerous factors. Sialic acid is an inflammatory factor that promotes cellular inflammation, particularly in the glial cells. That is why it could serve as a useful model for simulating several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's and Multiple sclerosis. Changes in sialic acid concentration are observed in many pathological states, which could be a useful marker for identifying the inflammatory process. The present study was carried out to examine the impact of different concentrations of sialic acid on two non-coding RNAs in glial cells. Our research shows that these two microRNAs greatly increased when responding to sialic acid. We suggest that these two microRNAs are contributed to the neuroinflammatory pathways related to sialic acid.</p><p>PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36457880/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=10guX6I3SqrbUeeLKSTD6FCRM44ewnrN2MKKTQLLPMHB4xNsZU&amp;fc=20210216052009&amp;ff=20221202071014&amp;v=2.17.8\">36457880</a> | PMC:<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC9706290/?utm_source=Other&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pubmed-2&amp;utm_content=10guX6I3SqrbUeeLKSTD6FCRM44ewnrN2MKKTQLLPMHB4xNsZU&amp;fc=20210216052009&amp;ff=20221202071014&amp;v=2.17.8\">PMC9706290</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.32598/bcn.2022.2090.1\">10.32598/bcn.2022.2090.1</a></p></div>","link":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36457880/?fc=20210216052009&ff=20221202071014&v=2.17.8","published_date":"2022-12-02T11:00:00Z","source":"PubMed","publisher":"Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Journal","container_title":"Basic and Clinical Neuroscience Journal","authors":[{"url":"http://api.gregory-ms.com/authors/80989/?format=json","family_name":"Noorbakhsh","given_name":"Negar","ORCID":null},{"url":"http://api.gregory-ms.com/authors/80990/?format=json","family_name":"Galehdari","given_name":"Hamid","ORCID":null},{"url":"http://api.gregory-ms.com/authors/80991/?format=json","family_name":"Shafiei","given_name":"Mohammad","ORCID":null}],"relevant":null,"ml_prediction_gnb":false,"ml_prediction_lr":false,"discovery_date":"2022-12-02T12:10:43.375913Z","noun_phrases":["The Effect","Sialic Acid","MiR-320a","Let-7e Expression","Human Glial Cell Line"],"doi":"10.32598/bcn.2022.2090.1","access":"open","takeaways":null},{"article_id":1119558,"title":"Multiple sclerosis and obesity: The role of adipokines","summary":"<div><p>Front Immunol. 2022 Nov 15;13:1038393. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2022.1038393. eCollection 2022.</p><p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p><p>Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that leads to demyelination and neurodegeneration has been associated with various environmental and lifestyle factors. Population-based studies have provided evidence showing the prevalence of MS is increasing worldwide. Because a similar trend has been observed for obesity and metabolic syndrome, interest has grown in possible underlying biological mechanisms shared by both conditions. Adipokines, a family of soluble factors produced by adipose tissue that participate in a wide range of biological functions, contribute to a low state of chronic inflammation observed in obesity, and influence immune function, metabolism, and nutritional state. In this review, we aim to describe epidemiological and biological factors common to MS and obesity, as well as provide an update on current knowledge of how different pro- and anti-inflammatory adipokines participate as immune response mediators in MS, as well as in the animal model for MS, namely, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) leading to demyelination, and neurodegeneration. Although its pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, there is considerable evidence to suggest MS arises from complex interactions between individual genetic susceptibility and external environmental factors. In recent decades, population-based studies have provided evidence indicating the prevalence of MS is increasing worldwide, in parallel with the rise in obesity and metabolic syndrome. This synchronous increment in the incidence of both MS and obesity has led to a search for potential biological mechanisms linking both conditions. Notably, a large number of studies have established significant correlation between obesity and higher prevalence, or worse prognosis, of several immune-mediated conditions. Fat tissue has been found to produce a variety of soluble factors named adipokines. These mediators, secreted by both adipocytes as well as diverse immune cells, participate in a wide range of biological functions, further strengthening the concept of a link between immune function, metabolism, and nutritional state. Because obesity causes overproduction of pro-inflammatory adipokines (namely leptin, resistin and visfatin) and reduction of anti-inflammatory adipokines (adiponectin and apelin), adipose tissue dysregulation would appear to contribute to a state of chronic, low-grade inflammation favoring the development of disease. In this review, we present a summary of current knowledge related to the pathological effects of different adipokines, prevalent in obese MS patients.</p><p>PMID:<a
