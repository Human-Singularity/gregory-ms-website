## Abstract

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex auto-immune disease that affects the central nervous system by damaging the myelin that protects nerve fibers. Currently, there is no cure for MS, but much research is conducted in this area. However, given the large volume of research published about MS, it can be challenging to stay informed about the latest advancements in the field.

In this paper, we present an approach based on machine learning to map and accelerate MS research. We propose a methodology to extract and rank relevant research articles for MS researchers, medical doctors, and patients. The methodology includes scraping scientific articles from online databases, storing them in a structured format, applying natural language processing techniques to extract meaningful features, and using machine learning algorithms to rank articles according to their relevance.

We evaluated our approach using a dataset of MS-related articles and found that it can effectively identify relevant research papers and provide insights into the current state of MS research. Our approach has the potential to accelerate MS research by helping researchers, doctors, and patients stay informed about the latest advancements in the field and by providing a structured overview of the current research landscape.
