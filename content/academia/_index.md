### A machine learning approach for mapping and accelerating multiple sclerosis research

**March 22, 2023**

Research by Ant√≥nio Lopes and Bruno Amaral on the machine learning technique used for GregoryAI. Harnessing intelligent reinforcement learning, our method maps and recommends valuable research material for multiple sclerosis studies. Through rigorous testing and evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, we have identified the most promising candidate to create a comprehensive and effective model for advancing multiple sclerosis research.
