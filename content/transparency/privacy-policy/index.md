## Privacy-First Medical Research Platform

Gregory MS is built with privacy as a fundamental principle. We believe that accessing medical research should not require sacrificing personal privacy or being subjected to invasive tracking. Our commitment to user privacy goes beyond legal compliance to represent our core values of respect and transparency.

### What Data We Don't Collect

**No Personal Tracking**
We do not track individual users across browsing sessions or collect personal browsing behavior data. There are no user accounts, login requirements, or personalization features that would necessitate individual user tracking.

**No Cookies for Tracking**
Gregory MS does not use tracking cookies, advertising cookies, or any form of cross-site tracking. We respect your privacy by not placing persistent identifiers on your device.

**No Third-Party Analytics**
We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, or any other third-party analytics services that could share your data with external companies or advertising networks.

**No Data Sales or Sharing**
We never sell user data or share personal information with third parties for commercial purposes. Your privacy is not a revenue source for Gregory MS.

### Minimal Data Collection

**GDPR-Compliant Analytics**
We use Umami Analytics, an open-source, privacy-focused analytics platform that we host ourselves. This provides essential website functionality insights while maintaining strict privacy standards:
- No personal identifiers are collected
- No IP address storage
- No cross-site tracking
- All data remains on our own servers
- Full transparency through our public analytics dashboard

**Essential Technical Data Only**
The only technical data we collect is necessary for basic website functionality:
- Page views (anonymous, aggregated)
- Browser type (for compatibility)
- General geographic region (country level only)
- Referral sources (to understand how users find us)

### Newsletter Subscription Data

**Minimal Information Collection**
For users who choose to subscribe to our email newsletters, we collect only the essential information needed to provide this service:
- Email address (for delivery)
- Name (for personalization)
- Stakeholder profile (patient, doctor, researcher, etc. for relevant content)

**Subscription Management**
- All newsletter subscriptions are completely voluntary
- Users can unsubscribe at any time with a single click
- We provide clear subscription management options
- No pressure tactics or re-engagement campaigns

**Data Retention Policy**
- Newsletter data is retained only as long as users maintain active subscriptions
- Upon unsubscription, all related data is permanently deleted within 30 days
- No archival copies or backups of unsubscribed user data are maintained

### Data Security and Protection

**Technical Safeguards**
- All data transmission is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols
- Server infrastructure includes enterprise-grade security measures
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments
- Restricted access controls for any systems containing user data

**Legal Compliance**
- Full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Adherence to international privacy standards and best practices
- Regular review of privacy policies to ensure continued compliance
- Transparent data processing in accordance with privacy laws

### User Rights and Control

**Data Access Rights**
Users have the right to know what data we have collected about them. For newsletter subscribers, this is limited to email address, name, and stakeholder profile information.

**Data Correction Rights**
Users can request corrections to any inaccurate data we maintain. Newsletter subscribers can update their preferences at any time through their subscription management interface.

**Data Deletion Rights**
Users can request complete deletion of their data from our systems. We provide multiple channels for deletion requests and guarantee complete removal within 30 days.

**Data Portability**
For newsletter subscribers, we can provide a complete export of all data we maintain in a standard, machine-readable format.

### Contact and Transparency

**Privacy Questions**
For any questions about our privacy practices, data collection, or to exercise your privacy rights, contact us at team@gregory-ms.com. We respond to all privacy inquiries within 72 hours.

**Regular Policy Updates**
This privacy policy is reviewed annually and updated as needed to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. All updates are announced to newsletter subscribers and posted prominently on our website.

**Open Source Commitment**
Our commitment to privacy extends to our open-source development approach. Our privacy-respecting analytics implementation and data handling practices are publicly viewable in our code repositories.

### International Users

**Global Privacy Standards**
Gregory MS serves users worldwide and maintains privacy standards that meet or exceed the most stringent international requirements, including GDPR, CCPA, and other regional privacy regulations.

**Data Location**
All user data is stored on servers located within the European Union, providing additional protection under EU privacy laws. We do not transfer personal data outside the EU without explicit consent and appropriate safeguards.
