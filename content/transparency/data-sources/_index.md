## Trusted Medical and Research Data Sources

Gregory MS aggregates multiple sclerosis research and clinical trial information from the world's most respected medical databases and research institutions. Our commitment to data quality means we only source information from authoritative, peer-reviewed, and clinically validated repositories.

### Research Article Sources

**PubMed (National Center for Biotechnology Information)**
The world's largest biomedical literature database, containing millions of peer-reviewed research articles from over 5,000 journals. We monitor PubMed for the latest multiple sclerosis research, including basic science studies, clinical trials, and review articles from leading medical journals.

**Europe PMC (European Bioinformatics Institute)**
A comprehensive repository of life sciences literature providing access to full-text articles and abstracts. Europe PMC helps us capture European research initiatives and international collaborations that may not be immediately available through other sources.

**Cochrane Library**
The gold standard for systematic reviews and evidence-based medicine. Cochrane reviews provide the highest quality analysis of multiple sclerosis treatments and interventions, helping us identify the most reliable research findings.

### Clinical Trial Databases

**ClinicalTrials.gov (U.S. National Library of Medicine)**
The world's largest clinical trial registry, maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. We monitor this database daily for new multiple sclerosis trials, including Phase I through Phase IV studies, observational research, and compassionate use programs.

**EU Clinical Trials Register (European Medicines Agency)**
The official European database for clinical trials, providing transparency for all trials conducted in the European Union. This source ensures we capture European research initiatives and trials that may offer opportunities for international participants.

**World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP)**
A global network that provides access to clinical trial information from registries worldwide. This helps us identify trials in developing countries and regions that might not be captured by Western databases.

### Quality Assurance and Data Validation

**Automated Monitoring Systems**
Our platform uses automated systems to monitor these sources continuously, checking for new publications and trial registrations multiple times per day. This ensures our users receive the most current information available.

**Expert Review Process**
All collected data undergoes review by our team of medical professionals and researchers to ensure relevance and accuracy. We verify trial eligibility criteria, contact information, and study details before making them available to our users.

**Regular Source Auditing**
We regularly audit our data sources to ensure they maintain their authoritative status and continue to provide high-quality, reliable information. Sources are evaluated based on peer review standards, institutional reputation, and data accuracy.

### Data Collection Standards
