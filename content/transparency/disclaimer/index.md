## Important Medical and Legal Disclaimers

Gregory MS is a research information platform designed to help patients, healthcare providers, and researchers access multiple sclerosis research and clinical trial information. However, it is crucial that all users understand the limitations and appropriate use of this platform.

### Not Medical Advice

**No Medical Training or Credentials**
Gregory MS is built and maintained by Bruno Amaral, who does not possess any formal medical training, medical degree, or healthcare credentials. The platform is created from the perspective of a patient and technology professional, not a medical expert.

**Information Only, Not Advice**
All content provided through Gregory MS, including research articles, clinical trial information, and platform-generated summaries, is for informational purposes only. Nothing on this platform constitutes:
- Medical advice or recommendations
- Diagnosis or diagnostic suggestions  
- Treatment protocols or therapeutic guidance
- Prescription recommendations or drug suggestions
- Clinical decision-making support

**Professional Medical Consultation Required**
All medical decisions, including treatment choices, medication changes, clinical trial participation, and diagnostic procedures, must be made in consultation with qualified healthcare professionals who have access to your complete medical history and current condition.

### Platform Limitations and Biases

**Algorithm Training and Bias**
Gregory MS uses machine learning algorithms to identify and prioritize relevant multiple sclerosis research. These algorithms were trained by a non-medical professional and inevitably reflect personal biases and interpretations of what constitutes "relevant" research.

**Manual Curation Limitations**
Research selection and platform content curation involves manual processes that are subject to human error, personal bias, and limitations in medical knowledge. The platform cannot guarantee comprehensive coverage of all relevant research.

**No Quality Assessment of Research**
Gregory MS aggregates research from various sources but does not evaluate the quality, validity, or clinical significance of individual studies. Users must apply their own critical evaluation or seek professional guidance to assess research quality.

### Data and Information Accuracy

**Third-Party Data Sources**
Most research and clinical trial information comes from third-party databases and repositories. While we strive for accuracy, Gregory MS cannot guarantee the completeness, timeliness, or accuracy of all information presented.

**No Real-Time Updates**
Information on clinical trials, including enrollment status, inclusion criteria, and contact details, may not reflect real-time changes. Always verify current information directly with trial investigators or clinical trial databases.

**Translation and Interpretation Errors**
Content processing, summarization, and presentation may introduce errors or misinterpretations of original research findings. Users should always refer to original research publications for authoritative information.

### Clinical Trial Information

**Not Enrollment Assistance**
Gregory MS provides clinical trial information for awareness purposes only. We do not facilitate enrollment, provide eligibility assessments, or serve as intermediaries between patients and researchers.

**Individual Eligibility Assessment Required**
Clinical trial eligibility is complex and individualized. Apparent eligibility based on general criteria does not guarantee actual eligibility, which must be determined through proper medical screening by qualified investigators.

**Geographic and Regulatory Limitations**
Clinical trial availability varies by geographic location, regulatory approval status, and local healthcare systems. Information presented may not reflect trials accessible in all regions.

### Legal and Liability Limitations

**No Warranties or Guarantees**
Gregory MS is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, including accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or fitness for any particular purpose.

**Limitation of Liability**
The creators and maintainers of Gregory MS shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of this platform or reliance on its information.

**User Responsibility**
Users are solely responsible for their interpretation and use of information found on Gregory MS. Any actions taken based on platform information are at the user's own risk and discretion.

### Intellectual Property and Content Use

**Third-Party Content Rights**
Research articles, abstracts, and clinical trial information remain the intellectual property of their original publishers and investigators. Gregory MS provides access and organization but does not claim ownership of research content.

**Fair Use and Educational Purpose**
Platform use of research content is intended for educational and informational purposes under fair use principles. Users must respect copyright and intellectual property rights when using or sharing content.

### Privacy and Data Collection

**Minimal Data Collection**
Gregory MS collects minimal user data and maintains strict privacy standards. However, users should review our privacy policy for complete information about data handling practices.

**Third-Party Analytics**
We use privacy-focused analytics tools to understand platform usage. Users can review our public analytics dashboard for transparency about data collection.

### Platform Availability and Continuity

**No Service Guarantees**
Gregory MS is a volunteer-maintained platform that may experience downtime, technical issues, or service interruptions. We cannot guarantee continuous availability or permanence of the platform.

**Community-Funded Operations**
Platform sustainability depends on community support and donations. Service continuity is not guaranteed and depends on ongoing community funding and volunteer effort.

### Appropriate Use Guidelines

**Educational and Research Purposes**
Gregory MS is intended for educational use by patients, caregivers, healthcare providers, and researchers seeking to understand the current state of multiple sclerosis research.

**Supplement, Not Replacement**
This platform should supplement, never replace, professional medical consultation, peer-reviewed medical literature review, or established clinical decision-making processes.

**Critical Evaluation Required**
All users should apply critical thinking and seek professional guidance when interpreting research information, especially when considering its relevance to individual medical situations.

**Gregory MS** is an Open Project built by [Bruno Amaral](https://brunoamaral.eu), who does not have any kind of medical training.

Therefore, please keep in mind none of the content found on this site is a prescription, recommendation, or even a suggestion. The information found here is meant to assist medical teams and researchers. 

We aim to save them time by gathering up-to-date information and highlighting articles relevant to new treatment protocols.

This is done manually and with the assistance of a [machine learning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning). This algorithm was trained by Bruno, and therefore reflects his bias and interpretation of what is relevant.
