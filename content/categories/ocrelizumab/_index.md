Paragraph: Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody medication used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic neurological disorder. MS involves the immune system attacking the protective covering of nerve fibers, called myelin, which leads to impaired nerve signal transmission and a range of symptoms. Ocrelizumab functions by targeting and depleting a specific type of immune cell, B cells, which contribute to the autoimmune response observed in MS. Consequently, this medication can reduce inflammation, decelerate the progression of the disease, and alleviate symptoms. Ocrelizumab has been approved for use in both relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS), highlighting its potential as a treatment option for various MS patients.
