Sanofi has reported positive new data from a mid-stage study of its investigational anti-CD40L antibody in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS).

Results from the phase 2 study, being presented at the 2023 Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers annual meeting, demonstrate that frexalimab significantly reduced disease activity in patients with relapsing forms of the disease.
