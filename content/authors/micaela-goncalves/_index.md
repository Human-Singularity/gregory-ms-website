Micaela is the newest addition to Gregory's team. As a structural engineer, she combines her technical career with a creative side, spending her free time playing the piano and painting with watercolors. Diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at the beginning of 2023, she faced the challenge with resilience, turning her personal experience into a source of motivation to make a meaningful contribution.

With a strong desire to make a difference, she decided to join the project after meeting Bruno, driven by the goal of improving knowledge-sharing among the various stakeholders in MS. Her aim is clear: to enhance the quality of life for people living with multiple sclerosis, fostering more effective and collaborative communication.
