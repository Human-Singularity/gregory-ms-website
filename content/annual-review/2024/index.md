The project is still called Gregory‑MS, but we refer to the software as Gregory‑AI. We chose this name because "MS" might suggest it only works for Multiple Sclerosis. In fact, the software can adapt to other diseases and medical research areas.

**Development and Collaborations**

- **Gregory AI Enhancements**  
  We expanded Gregory AI’s capabilities to support multiple research subjects on a single platform. This flexible approach benefits not just MS research but also other areas such as brain regeneration, enabling diverse research teams to tap into up-to-date data and findings.

- **Email List Overhaul**  
  We completely redesigned the email alert system, giving researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients more options to subscribe to precisely the information they need — be it new articles, clinical trials, or administrative summaries.

- **New Clinical Trial Registry**  
  Adding the [Clinical Trial Information System (CTIS)](https://euclinicaltrials.eu/) as a source means users get even more complete coverage of trials around the globe. Gregory AI can now track changes or new listings from the largest registries worldwide, further streamlining how we monitor research.

- **Collaborations with REGENERAR and GENIE**  
  Two new clinical research groups — [REGENERAR for brain regeneration](https://research.regenerar.eu/) and [GENIE for autoimmune encephalitis](https://investigacao.encefalites.pt/) — are using Gregory AI as a real-time map of relevant studies, opening doors to new treatments.

## Observatories and Research Insights

- **Brain Regeneration Focus**  
  Following our conversations with the Horizon Europe - funded REGENERAR project, we launched a dedicated instance of Gregory AI to gather and share studies about neurological repair. This marks a step toward assisting other neurodegenerative conditions beyond MS.

- **Continued MS Monitoring**  
  While we broadened our scope, MS remains a priority. We’re refining algorithms developed in part with Nova SBE’s Project-Based Learning Program to better identify papers addressing patient outcomes. This aims to provide the MS community with more tangible, patient-focused insights.

## Advancements in Clinical Trials

- **Expanded Coverage**  
  As mentioned before, we added CTIS alongside existing sources like ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO registry. We've strengthened our ability to track new research across continents.

## Financial Overview and Team Contributions

- **First Year of Self-Sustainability**  
  Thanks to generous donations, Gregory MS managed to shoulder a greater share of its hosting and email costs. This financial independence underlines the community’s trust in the project and its goals.

- **Key Numbers for 2024**  
  Our database now has over 30,000 articles and over 5,000 clinical trials. We also welcomed over 160 subscribers, with the majority identifying as patients, but a growing segment of doctors, researchers, and clinical centers.

- **New Team Member**  
  We’re delighted to introduce *Micaela Gonçalves*, who brings a fresh perspective and energy.

## Media and Social Media Presence

- **Social Growth**  
  While changes in social media policies continue, our presence on [Mastodon (@gregory-ms@med-mastodon.com)](https://med-mastodon.com/@gregoryMS) and [BlueSky (@Gregory-MS.com)](https://bsky.app/profile/Gregory-MS.com) has grown. Automating updates ensures the MS community can quickly see newly published research and clinical trials.

- **Community Engagement**  
  We continue to listen to feedback from patients, healthcare professionals, and researchers, using their insights to develop new features.

## Future Aspirations

- **Refining AI Models**  
  Implementing the NOVA SBE algorithm remains a top priority. We want to improve our content recommendations to highlight studies with measurable patient outcomes.

- **Expanding Collaborative Projects**  
  Beyond REGENERAR and GENIE, we aim to extend partnerships with clinical research organizations, innovators, and patient advocacy groups to maximize our impact.
