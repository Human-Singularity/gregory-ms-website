Gregory AI has undergone significant improvements, introducing more accurate and tailored algorithms to help Multiple Sclerosis (MS) researchers quickly identify relevant studies. These updates, made possible by collaboration with Nova SBE, improve flexibility, performance, and accuracy, directly benefiting researchers, patients, and the broader MS community.

Gregory AI was created with a clear mission: to help Multiple Sclerosis (MS) researchers, patients, and caregivers easily find and track relevant scientific papers and clinical trials. Today, we're excited to share an important update that significantly improves Gregory AI's capabilities.

### A Long-Overdue Improvement

We know this update was long overdue, and the reason was the substantial amount of rewriting and improvement our codebase required. Ensuring the foundational technology is robust and flexible was essential for Gregory AI to reliably serve researchers and patients now and into the future. The effort involved extensive testing, refinement, and patience—but the result was well worth the wait.

### Thanks to Nova SBE

This milestone was made possible thanks to the incredible support and expertise provided by our partners at Nova School of Business and Economics (Nova SBE). They were instrumental in driving the research and development of new, advanced algorithms to enhance Gregory AI.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to:

* **Leid Zejnilovic**, **Lénia Mestrinho**, **Susana Lavado**, and **Bruna Riboldi**
* Master's students: **Nicolò Mazzoleni**, **Kuba Bialczyk**, **Julia Antonioli**, **Martim Esteves**, and **Francisco Gomes**
* Mentors: **Patrícia Xufre** (Data Science Mentor) and **Tiago Godinho** (Business & Management Mentor)

### What's New and How It Helps

#### More Accurate Results

Gregory AI can now more accurately identify studies specifically relevant to MS. Researchers will spend less time filtering through unrelated content, making it easier and faster to access critical information.

#### Improved Flexibility and Performance

Our updated and improved software architecture provides greater flexibility. Future enhancements, updates, and new features will now be easier and quicker to implement.

#### Tailored Predictions

Each research subject now benefits from its own predictive model, offering more precise and relevant results. Whether you're focusing on clinical trials or the latest biomedical research, Gregory AI provides tailored insights to meet your specific needs.

### Behind the Scenes

The updated code was developed with the assistance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence tool, under close supervision by our development team. This ensured both accuracy and quality, providing a solid foundation for reliable and ongoing improvements.

### What This Means for You

* **Researchers**: Faster and more precise access to relevant MS research.
* **Patients and MS Communities**: Stay informed effortlessly about new and relevant clinical findings.
* **Donors and Supporters**: Your contributions have a direct and visible impact, fueling essential improvements.
