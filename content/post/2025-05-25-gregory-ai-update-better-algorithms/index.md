GregoryAi went through significant improvements this week. We implemented more accurate algorithms to help Multiple Sclerosis (MS) researchers receive relevant studies, and added multi-team and multi-subject support so that Gregory can cover more than just MS. These updates, made possible by collaboration with Nova SBE, improve flexibility, performance, and accuracy, to the direct benefit of the MS community.

GregoryAi was created with a clear mission: to help Multiple Sclerosis (MS) researchers, patients, and caregivers find and track relevant scientific papers and clinical trials. Today, we're a tiny step closer to that goal.

### A Long-Overdue Improvement

We know this update was long overdue, and the reason was the substantial amount of rewriting and improvement our code required. 

### Thanks to Nova SBE

This milestone was made possible thanks to the expertise provided by NOVA School of Business and Economics (Nova SBE). They were instrumental in driving the research of new algorithms to enhance GregoryAi.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to:

* **Leid Zejnilovic**, **Lénia Mestrinho**, and **Susana Lavado**
* Master's students: **Nicolò Mazzoleni**, **Kuba Bialczyk**, **Julia Antonioli**, **Martim Esteves**, and **Francisco Gomes**
* Mentors: **Patrícia Xufre** (Data Science Mentor) and **Tiago Godinho** (Business & Management Mentor)

### What's New and How It Helps

#### More Accurate Results

GregoryAi can now more accurately identify studies relevant to MS and other research subjects, as long as we have enough training data. This means less time filtering through unrelated content, making it easier and faster for patients and researchers to access new research.


#### Improved Flexibility

We believe that other areas of medical research can benefit people with MS (PwMS). That's why this new update allows different teams to use GregoryAI without getting in each other's way. And there is more.

#### Tailored Predictions

Each research subject now benefits from having its own predictive model, trained with papers that reflect a specific goal. For example, within MS we can have a model focused on Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) or one focused on regenerating the myelin sheath.

### Behind the Scenes

The updated code was developed with the assistance of Claude 3.7 Sonnet under supervision by us. 

While the output is meeting our expectations, there are some concerns regarding code quality and adherence to the documentation provided by NOVA SBE. This is a concern that we will do our best to address from now on. 

We would never have been able to add the new features without the help of GenAI tools and, so far, the benefits outweight the risks.

### What This Means for You

* **Researchers**: Faster and more precise access to relevant MS research.
* **Patients and MS Communities**: Stay informed effortlessly about new and relevant clinical findings.
