### The short version

GregoryAI exists to make the MS knowledge landscape easier to navigate. We monitor new publications and clinical trials and turn them into timely, useful signals patients can bring to their clinicians — and that clinicians and researchers can act on. In this MS Perspektive interview, Bruno Amaral (founder of GregoryAI) shares how a personal MS journey led to a practical, community-driven tool with a simple promise: do what we can, with what we have, to move research forward together.

### A condensed personal context

Bruno first noticed mobility issues in 2019. After multiple opinions and an MRI, he began treatment (initially with natalizumab, with a plan toward ocrelizumab). As disability progressed, he explored options and ultimately underwent aHSCT at the University Hospital of Coimbra. That experience — searching for options, matching information to decisions, and leaning on a supportive community — shaped the core idea behind GregoryAI.

### Why GregoryAI was built

- **Cut through noise:** There is more MS research than ever, but it’s scattered across journals and registries. GregoryAI focuses on surfacing what’s actionable.
- **Bridge patients and clinicians:** Patients often hear about trials late (if at all). We help them bring relevant options to the clinical conversation sooner.
- **Support researchers:** By mapping topics and trends, we aim to help researchers see where effort is concentrated — and where gaps (like myelin repair) need more attention.
- **Be practical and transparent:** GregoryAI began as a small, home-grown project and remains mission-first and community-driven.

### What GregoryAI does today

- **Timely alerts:** Anyone can subscribe (free) to get newly published research and clinical trials worth discussing with their care team.
- **Trial awareness:** We make it easier to spot opportunities across multiple registries so clinicians and patients can evaluate fit earlier.
- **Topic mapping foundations:** We’re working toward clearer visual overviews of research domains to highlight under-explored areas.

### Ongoing challenges we’re tackling

- **Information fragmentation:** Keeping track of what’s new, relevant, and reliable across sources.
- **Accessibility of language:** Clinical-trial and paper abstracts are technical; we’re exploring better ways to summarize without losing nuance.
- **Coordinating priorities:** The MS field still leans heavily toward anti-inflammatory strategies. Repair and regeneration need more shared focus.

### A call to collaborate

This interview is also an invitation. If you’re a **researcher**, **clinician**, **data scientist**, or **digital health builder**:

- Partner with us to **improve topic mapping** and evidence triage.
- Help refine **criteria for trial and paper relevance**.
- Explore **co-authored analyses** to inform community and policy conversations.
- Co-design **patient-clinician workflows** that fit real-world clinics.

If you’re a **patient or caregiver**:

- **Subscribe to alerts** and bring the most relevant items to your medical team.
- Share feedback — it genuinely shapes what we build next.

### Gratitude

Our thanks to **MS Perspektive** and host **Nele Handwerker** for the thoughtful conversation and platform. And thank you to everyone who has supported GregoryAI with ideas, testing, and encouragement. Your feedback moves this project forward.
