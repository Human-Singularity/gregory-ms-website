			<h2 id="our-story" class="h4">Our story</h2>
			<p>
				In 2019, our founder <a href="https://brunoamaral.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruno Amaral</a> was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Like many people with MS, he faced a flood of information and a shortage of clarity. In 2021, Gregory-MS.com was launched as a focused, transparent way to track what truly matters: rigorous studies, promising results, and clinical trials. We build it openly so others can learn from — and build on — our work.
			</p>
			<p class="mb-4">
				Gregory-MS is stewarded by a small, volunteer-driven team and supported by an open-source codebase. <a href="https://lisboncollective.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lisbon Collective</a> is Bruno’s consultancy and helps cover running costs so the project can keep serving the MS community.
